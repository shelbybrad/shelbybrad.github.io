This is a great repo to clone/fork if you want:

  * To make a Jekyll site
  * To host it on GitHub pages without any trouble
  * Lots of built-in documentation, like style guides and UX guidelines
  *

## Installation

  1. Fork the repository (button at top of repo page)
  2. On your forked repository page, go to 'Settings' and rename the repository to match your desired behavior
    * Most of the time you will want `user/organization-name`.github.io
    * It can also be any name, typically using the `gh-pages` branch
  3. Edit to your heart's content

### Creating a local version for development

  3. Run the command `bundle install` in the root of project
  4. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build and serve your site
