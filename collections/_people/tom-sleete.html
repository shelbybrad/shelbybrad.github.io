      Tom is many good adjectives. Let's go with <em>reliable</em> most of all.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Sleete is a born-and-raised Detroiter. He was married to his wife, Moe, for 38Â½ years before her passing. Tom
      is a proud father of three children, and grandfather to two grandchildren.
    </p>

    <p>
      He taught History at Southfield-Lathrup High for like 40 years. He's still active as an author and historian, and as
      a retiree consults for the College Board in AP US History.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tom starts his days, like clockwork, with a trip to the grocery store. He ends the day with his prayers. In between
      he makes the world that much brighter to his family and friends.
