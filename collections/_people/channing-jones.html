<p>
  Channing is reassurance personified.
</p>

<p>
  She grew up in Troy, Michigan in the nineties, middle child of the Sleete family. Channing studied speech pathology and
  French in college, and makes a life of helping people as a speech language pathologist. Before her current hospital gig,
  she plied her trade at Berkley High School.
</p>

<p>
  She lives in Maryland with her husband, Mike, and their young son Leander. She enjoys trashy reality TV, and is the best
  aunt ever.
</p>

<p>
  Channing exudes calm and acceptance; qualities we are glad to have in an officiant on our wedding day!
</p>
