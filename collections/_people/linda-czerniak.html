<p>
  Linda is everyone's rock. She makes sure to keep in touch with all her friends and family, and to be there for them
  when they need someone.
</p>

<p>
  She grew up in Dearborn Heights, Michigan, eldest of a sister and two brothers. Growing up, she took to the piano and
  accordion, which she taught to others later in life. She studied music and business, and later met Steve, whom she
  married. She excelled at raising three boys while working various jobs in the community.
</p>

<p>
  Linda loves most games and puzzles, handicrafts, cooking, and her family most of all. She's earned all of the "World's
  Best Grandma" swag many times over, evidenced any time you see her with Johnna.
