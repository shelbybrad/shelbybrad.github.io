## Details

We're still ironing out the details on this. Everything is subject to change.

Since the ceremony and reception dinner are so small, this weekend will be the main opportunity for Brad to celebrate with
his cohort of guy friends. The current plan is a night or two of not-too-primitive camping somewhere in Michigan; not
aggressively far from the Metro-Detroit area.
