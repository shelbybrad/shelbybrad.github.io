## Details

TBD.

We will either designate a restaurant that serves brunch within a few miles of the reception dinner venue for everyone to
meet at, or will have an open house-style brunch at a private residence.

In either event, any friends or family are welcome to come, regardless of whether you were invited to the other events. We
would love to see you!

## Contact

If you have questions, or would like to join the brunch planning committee, please contact
[Linda Czerniak](mailto:linda.czerniak@gmail.com).
