## Details

**We are planning a very small, private ceremony, and are hoping you'll respect our wishes.**

In front of our immediate families (who will be personally invited), Shelby and Brad will wed.

### Dress code

Please dress for the weather.

### Afterward

There's a pretty solid chance we'll all go out to dinner afterward, so if you're invited to the ceremony it's probably
advisable not to make elaborate plans for that evening.
