## @file
## Search page
##
## This page is part of the jekyll SSG system overall, but acts like its own app. This is both because it has a lot of
## special functionality that other pages don't need to load, but also for demonstration purposes of having an SPA
## 'siloed' within the overall system.
##
## Tools like React, Vue, Svelte, Alpine, Stimulus, etc. can be used in their own
## contexts without affecting the operation of the rest of the site.
